# PINN-for-1-d-Heat-Conduction-CHT-
This project demonstrates a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) solving the 1-D transient heat conduction equation. Unlike traditional CFD solvers that require meshes and time-stepping, this approach learns a continuous temperature field directly by embedding the governing PDE and boundary/initial conditions into the networkâ€™s loss function.
